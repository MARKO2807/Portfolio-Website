          Hey, I’m Marko Bare – a kinesiologist turned web developer! I believe
          technology should feel intuitive and accessible, so I build user
          interfaces that don’t just look great but also offer seamless
          experiences. For me, coding is the perfect mix of creativity and
          problem-solving – I’m always finding smart ways to blend design with
          functionality. I love the challenge of turning complex ideas into
          clean, user-friendly designs that make a real impact. Whether it’s
          refining interactions or optimizing performance, I’m always looking
          for ways to enhance the digital experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing chess or exploring new
          technologies – two passions that keep me thinking strategically and
          adapting to new challenges. If you're looking for someone who brings
          fresh perspectives and enthusiasm to building digital experiences,
          let’s connect – I’d love to chat about new ideas!
